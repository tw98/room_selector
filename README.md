# Roommate Randomizer

This script randomly assigns people from a larger group to rooms and automatically creates a slideshow to present the room assignments. The Randomizer automatically creates clean, nicely-formatted pictures to show the room assignments. Works for an arbitrary number of people (tested for 2-12 people)

Input:
- csv file with cols: 
    - firstName
    - lastName 
    - nickname 
    - picture (name of picture file)
    - status (status of players (squad or not))
- corresponding pictures (in separate folder called ./pics). 

I wrote the script to randomize the hotel room assignments on away trips with my soccer team
