# Roommate Randomizer

This script groups a number of people from a larger group together in a random manner and builds a presentation to show the assignments. The script automatically formats the room assignments based on number of people in the room (layout tested for 2-12 people)

Input:
- csv file with cols: 
    - firstName
    - lastName 
    - nickname 
    - picture (name of picture file)
    - status (status of players (squad or not))
- corresponding pictures (in separate folder called ./pics). 

I wrote the script to randomize the hotel room assignments on away trips with my soccer team
