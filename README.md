# Roommate Randomizer

This script groups 2-3 people from a larger group together in a random manner. Matches names (input given as textfile, must be in same dict as script) with given corresponding nicknames (textfile) and corresponding pictures (in seperate dict called ./pics). 

I wrote the script to randomize the hotel room assignments on away trips with my soccer team
